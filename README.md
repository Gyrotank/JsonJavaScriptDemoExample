# JsonJavaScriptDemoExample
This is an example demonstrating interaction between a REST controller and a JavaScript on a JSP.

JavaScript calls a controllers method via getJSON function and turns the resulting JSON generated by Jackson and containing 
collection of employees into a list of last names of employees followed by buttons which display their full info when pressed.

HTML-code for list and buttons is generated dynamically by the script.
